CollectionViewLoaderTest
========================

Loads a collection of images through AFNetworking and JSON parser and then allows the user to open each cell on the collection view by flicking (using UIGestureRecognise) or tapping. The user can then cycle through each each once the expanded view is opened, and then close the expanded view by pinching.
